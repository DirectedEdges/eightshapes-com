                Discovery is messy, chaotic, and poorly defined. Is it just research? Or something more? Do all your teams do discovery in the same way? Should they?
            </p>
            <p>In this workshop we’ll take a step back from the day-to-day, looking across discovery efforts to understand what they have in common. We’ll look at what makes them more than research, and how to make them practical for any effort. We’ll establish a vocabulary for talking about how to do discovery. With this foundation, we’ll ask teams to map their process so everyone has a clear picture of what everyone else is doing.</p>

                The first half of the workshop covers theory, the building blocks of what discovery is and why it’s important. The second half goes into the practicalities of determining a schedule and outputs for discovery.

            <p>
                Both halves include exercises throughout to reinforce the concepts and provide some experience with discovery techniques. We can customize the exercises to align with current projects or challenges facing your team.
