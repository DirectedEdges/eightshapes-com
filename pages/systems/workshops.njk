                        Most in-house teams choose to customize their agenda to tailor topics to their current needs. This may result in a workshop lengthened to two days or shortened a half day (usually paired with a sponsored talk for a larger group).

                    <h3>At Carmax, an Evening Talk and then Half–Day Workshop</h3>

                    <p>
                        Carmax paired a sponsored talk for the local Richmond, VA community with a customized half-day in-house workshop. They paired a segment to align in-house system efforts with topics covering how to serve system customers and contributors. As a result, they omitted topics of system design, code and documentation.
