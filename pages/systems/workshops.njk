                EightShapes will customize a workshop for you that blends and prioritizes topics across a day or two together. For each topic, we'll find the right balance of <b>lecture</b>, hands-on <b>activities</b>, <b>discussion</b>, and – if you're ready – <b>critique</b> of your team's materials. If a default agenda suits your needs, excellent! Need to focus on some topics more than others? We'll customize an agenda to suit your needs.

Their objectives were to align multiple system efforts and better serve system customers and contributors. As a result, they omitted most topics of design, code and documentation.
