                        Most in-house teams choose to customize their agenda to tailor topics to their current needs. This may result in a workshop lengthened to two days or shortened a half day (usually paired with a sponsored talk for a larger group).

                    <h3>Example 1: Half Day for Organization with Multiple Systems</h3>

                    <p>
                        In one instance, a company paired an sponsored talk to the local community with a customized half-day in-house workshop. They chose to focus on aligning multiple in-house system efforts around a future strategy along topics covering how to practice systems. As a result, they omitted topics of system design, code and documentation.
