                Discovery begins the design process for something new or for improving what you already have. Discovery’s outcome supports a crucial decision: how should we move forward? <strong>Our aim is to make the next steps as clear and direct as possible</strong>, therefore our discovery projects yield a prototype and a plan.

            <p>Discovery concludes with a crucial inflection, the decision about moving forward. Your team’s green light may require aligning around a direction, getting executive buy-in, securing funding, or all of the above. We will work with you to determine the criteria for a green light, and to produce a prototype that meets those criteria.</p>
