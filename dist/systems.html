      <h2>Design’s future is modular. It’s always been components.</h2>
      <p>Designers code more and are delivering their work as a toolkit of interdependent parts. Thinking modularly is now a key trait for today’s high performing teams. Everyone’s thinking atomic.</p>
      <p>EightShapes has been thinking in @components for years, helping clients start and sustain component libraries for nearly 10 years and sharing the practices with 2009’s Modular Web Design.</p>
